# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifies the requirements for developing a simple "Hello World" web page. The document serves as a reference for developers, stakeholders, and project team members involved in the implementation of this basic web application.

## 1.2 Scope
The project encompasses the development of a single static web page that displays the text "Hello World". The web page will:
- Consist of a single HTML file
- Display the greeting message "Hello World"
- Be accessible through standard web browsers
- Serve as a minimal demonstration of web page creation

The project explicitly excludes:
- Multiple pages or navigation
- Backend functionality
- User interaction features
- Database integration
- Authentication systems

# 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

## 2.1 Product Perspective
The "Hello World" web page is a standalone, self-contained system that operates independently of other software systems. It represents the most basic form of a web page, serving as an entry-level example of web development. The page will be viewable through any standard web browser without requiring additional software or systems.

## 2.2 Product Functions
The web page provides the following core function:
- Display the text message "Hello World" in a web browser window

## 2.3 User Characteristics
The intended users of this web page include:
- Beginning web developers learning HTML basics
- Technical trainers demonstrating web development concepts
- Quality assurance testers verifying basic web functionality

No special technical expertise is required to view or use the web page, as it only requires basic familiarity with using a web browser.

## 2.4 Constraints
The following constraints apply to the project:
- Must use only HTML (no CSS or JavaScript)
- Must be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Must be contained within a single file
- File size must not exceed 1KB
- Must load and display in under 1 second

## 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Assumptions:
- Users have access to a modern web browser
- Users have basic internet connectivity
- The web page will be served via standard HTTP/HTTPS protocols

Dependencies:
- Web server capability to serve static HTML files
- Browser compliance with HTML standards
- DNS resolution for web hosting (if deployed online)
